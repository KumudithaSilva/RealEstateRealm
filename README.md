## Project Overview 📊

The primary objective revolves around the construction of a predictive model aimed at estimating property prices based on a diverse set of features, including square footage, bedroom and bathroom counts, as well as geographical location. Additionally, a user-centric website will be created, and a cloud platform will empower users to utilize the developed model hosted and utilize it.

## Project Architecture 🏗️

The project will follow these steps:

- 📂 Data Collection: Obtain the dataset from Kaggle for real estate price prediction.
- 🛠️ Data Preprocessing: Perform essential data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and outlier removal. Seaborn, a powerful data visualization library, will be employed to gain insights into the dataset.
- ⚙️ Machine Learning Model: Build a machine learning model for predicting property prices, utilizing Python's pandas and scikit-learn libraries.
- 📦 Model Persistence: Export the trained model to a pickle file for future use.
- ⚡ Flask Server: Develop a Python Flask server to consume the pickle file of the trained model. This server will expose HTTP endpoints to handle prediction requests.
- ☁️ AWS Integration: Deploy the Flask server and the trained model on AWS, leveraging its cloud capabilities for scalability and accessibility.
- 🌐 Web Application: Create a user-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website will communicate with the Flask server hosted on AWS to provide users with property price predictions.
